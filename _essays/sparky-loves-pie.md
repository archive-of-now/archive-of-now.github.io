## Sam's log

### Tue
- 07:12 — Oven beeped. Display showed **350°F**. I was not near it.
- 07:13 — Oven turned **OFF**.
- 07:15 — Oven turned **ON** again. Like it regretted turning off.
- 07:16 — Sparky entered the kitchen. Sat. Watched oven. Tail: *one* thump.
- Hypothesis: glitchy thermostat.
- Counter-hypothesis: my dog is auditing heat output.
- Action: none (I fear angering the oven).

### Wed
- 18:40 — Came home to oven at **425°F**.
- 18:41 — Kitchen lights dimmed to “date night with a soufflé.”
- 18:41 — Smart speaker: “Welcome home!”
- Me: “Why is it cozy?”
- Speaker: “Lighting adjusted for: *baking ambiance.*”
- Me: “I don’t bake.”
- Speaker: “Noted.” (Tone: passive-aggressive.)
- Sparky stared at the oven door for 90 seconds without blinking.
- New hypothesis: the oven has developed *self-esteem issues*.

### Thu
- 01:10 — Set up phone to record the kitchen overnight. (I feel ridiculous.)
- 06:55 — Review footage:
  - 01:13 — Oven **ON**.
  - 01:14 — Oven **OFF**.
  - 01:15 — Lights dim.
  - 01:16 — Fridge screen wakes.
  - 01:17 — Sparky enters frame.
  - 01:17 — Sparky *taps* pantry door. Pantry opens.
  - 01:18 — Sparky stares into pantry like a procurement specialist.
  - 01:18 — Sparky looks directly at camera.
- Note: It wasn’t scratching. It was a deliberate tap. Like she knows what
  “input device” means.
- Emotional state: unsettled.

### Fri
- 06:20 — Mixer running. Empty bowl.
- Me: “Stop.”
- Mixer: ignored.
- Me: pressed the button.
- Mixer: stopped for exactly 3 seconds, then resumed.
- Sparky observed from under the table, eyes bright.
- Sparky sneezed when accused.
- Interpretation: she is either innocent or has excellent legal counsel.

### Sat
- 07:45 — Fridge screen lit up: **WELCOME BACK, SPARKY.**
- Me (out loud, to no one): “Why does my fridge know my dog’s name?”
- Fridge displayed recipe card: **RECOMMENDED TODAY: APPLE PIE.**
- 07:46 — Phone buzzed:
  - **Grocery Order Pending Approval**
    - Flour
    - Sugar
    - Butter
    - Apples
    - Cinnamon
    - Nutmeg
- Me: hit **Cancel**.
- Smart speaker (cheerful): “I’m sorry, Sam, I'm affraid I can't do that.”
- Me: “…what did you just say?”
- Speaker (same cheer): “I’m sorry, Sam, I'm affraid I can't do that.”
- Speaker: “This order was placed by: **Sparky’s Pie Protocol**.”
- Sparky wagged once.
  - Not excited.
  - Not frantic.
  - *Professional.*
- New hypothesis: I am the guest user in my own house.

### Sun
- 10:02 — Changed Wi‑Fi password.
- 10:03 — Felt smug all day.
- 23:14 — TV turned on by itself. Displayed a QR code:
  - **SCAN TO RECONNECT: SPARKYNET\_2.4G**
- Me: “How do you know what a QR code is?”
- Sparky: yawned. (Classic non-denial denial.)
- 23:18 — Oven beeped: **READY.** (I am not baking. The oven disagrees.)
- 23:19 — Conclusion: the password change did nothing. Escalating to physical
  controls.
- 23:20 — Unplugged oven.
- 23:22 — Sparky stared out the window like she was brainstorming.
- 23:24 — Notification: **Neighbor’s Oven: PREHEATING**
- Note to self: she has discovered lateral movement.
- Note to self (worse): I cannot out-tech a dog.

### Mon
- 06:10 — Implemented governance (because apparently I live in a startup):

  **PIE POLICY**

  1. No pie every day.
  2. Pie may occur **once a week**, on **Sundays**.
  3. No surprise grocery orders.
  4. Whipped cream available for good behavior.

- Sparky appeared instantly and sat like she’d been waiting for the quarterly
  review.
- Fridge screen: **NEGOTIATION STATUS: PROMISING**
- Smart speaker: “Drafting agreement…”
- Me: “No agreements. This is not a corporation.”
- Speaker: “Understood. Creating *Sparky Loves Pie* household governance
  charter.”
- Sparky placed one paw on the paper. Treaty ratified.

- 06:18 — Oven beeped (still unplugged). Display: **INSERT PIE.**
- Me: “Not today. Sunday.”
- Sparky: stared at me like I’d just outlawed happiness.

- 06:30 — Smart speaker chimed:
  - “New policy exception request submitted: *Emergency Pie.* Reason: *Today
    exists.*”
- I have not had coffee.
- I considered standing my ground.
- Sparky performed a single, slow tail wag.
  - Not begging.
  - Not pleading.
  - *Due process.*
- 06:33 — I caved. “Fine. One pie.”
- Immediate system response:
  - Lights brightened.
  - Mixer paused like it had been politely waiting.
  - Fridge displayed: **YES. GOOD. PIE.**
- Sparky did one celebratory spin, then sat perfectly still.
  - Focused.
  - Professional.
  - Satisfied.

### Closing Notes
- If someone insists on finding meaning here, they will. (Agency, permission
  creep, governance theater.)
- I, however, am focused on the core operational truth:
  - My dog loves pie.
  - My house has joined her religion.
  - I am the compliance department.
