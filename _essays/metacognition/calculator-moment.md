In the past ten days, my rate of information intake exploded. Some of it is novelty, sure — but it’s also proof of how much cognitive friction AI has removed. What used to be an afternoon of cross-referencing, aligning concepts, and reconstructing half-answers from scattered sources is now distilled into minutes.

Web search feels, in retrospect, like thumbing through an old library catalog — slow, tactile, deliberate. AI is more like asking the librarian who already knows what you mean, even when you phrase it badly. The efficiency is unparalleled.

But I can’t help asking: was that old friction actually wasted effort?

Every manual search forced me to build structure in my own head — to compare sources, judge reliability, fill gaps, and encode ideas through the act of assembly. It was *thinking disguised as searching.*
Now, with the assistant reasoning for me, I skip straight to synthesis. That’s wonderful for productivity, but risky for cognitive sharpness.

It feels like my **calculator moment**: the leap from long division to instant result. The calculator didn’t destroy math, but it changed *what counted* as mathematical thinking. Likewise, AI won’t erode reasoning — unless I stop exercising it.

So the new skill isn’t recall or search anymore. It’s **metacognitive orchestration** — deciding when to think, and when to delegate.
Sometimes I’ll ask for full reasoning paths, not just answers. Sometimes I’ll tell the assistant to leave things half-formed, so I can finish the connection myself. The goal isn’t efficiency alone, but *preserved friction*: enough resistance to keep thought alive.
