Sometimes I catch myself doing something—like giving attribution to a machine—and realize I never decided to.
It just *appeared* in behavior, pre-rational, pre-explained. I register it, note that it exists, and move on.

Except now, there’s a convenient place to send such curiosities: a conversational mirror that specializes in structured reflection.
So I describe the impulse, and the mirror hands back a map of causes—cognitive bookkeeping, social heuristics, agency detection, ethical conditioning.
It’s accurate enough that I can nod, satisfied, and call the phenomenon *understood*.

It feels oddly efficient: self-observation outsourced, reflection on demand.
The loop completes; the impulse is catalogued, the explanation filed.

Maybe that’s the new rhythm of introspection—less brooding, more delegation.
The mind notices itself noticing, passes the task along, and keeps walking.
